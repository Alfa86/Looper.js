# Looper.js

Looper.js is a vanilla JS library that uses API and looping through array of objects for populating DOM content with ease.

## Installation

Include js file in your project like this: 

```javascript
<script src="Looper.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Create element with data-link attribute and give him API link. Inside of that element you can create template which Looper.js is going to use for populating.
